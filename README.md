## Presentation

Hi! I'm Víctor Álvarez Aparicio, math and scientific programming enthusiast. I'm currently working as a research fellow in University of La Rioja (Spain), studying
applications of Topology in the field of Iteration of Rational Maps and Complex Dynamics. My colleagues and I mainly develop our algorithms in Julia Language, though
some of them are also available in Mathematica.

My interests are Algebraic Topology, Differential Topology, Complex Dynamics and Ergodic Theory, Iterative Proccesses, Scientific Programming, Julia Language, TDA (Topological 
Data Analysis), among others. I'm really glad and excited to join this community and to share our contributions with everyone interested.
